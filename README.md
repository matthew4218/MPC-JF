# MPC-JF ▸ External media player for Jellyfin Web
### ▸ MPC-BE & MPC-HC & Potplayer Support, may support other media players .exe by following step #2
### ▸ Tested with Jellyfin 10.11+, local or NAS JF server, Windows 11, Jellyfin Web UI on Firefox-based or Chrome-based browsers
## Installation Steps

### 0. Download MPC-JF.zip
Download **latest for Jellyfin 10.11.+** : [MPC-JF.zip](https://github.com/Damocles-fr/MPC-JF/releases/)

### 1. Place Required Files
- Extract and move the MPC-JF folder to :
  ```
  C:\ProgramData\
  ```
- You should end up with: `C:\ProgramData\MPC-JF\` (with all files inside).

### 2 : If you don't use ***MPC-BE*** and his default path :
- Edit the file `MPCJF.ps1` and replace the path ***in the last line*** with ***your own*** corresponding path. (MPC-HC or any other player path)
- E.g. for PotPlayer default path : ``` & "C:\Program Files\DAUM\PotPlayer\PotPlayerMini64.exe" "`"$path`"" ```

### 3. Install ViolentMonkey
- In your web browser, install ViolentMonkey extension :
https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/
	###### Alternatively you can use TamperMonkey or any userscript extension
	###### MPCJF.js can be put in Jellyfin JavaScript Injector plugin instead, but every play buttons in Jellyfin Web won't work anywhere else without MPC-JF.

### 4. Install MPCJF.js userscript in ViolentMonkey
- Install MPCJF.js into ViolentMonkey, one-click install with auto-update : [MPCJF.js Userscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Damocles-fr/MPC-JF/refs/heads/main/MPCJF.js)
- If your Jellyfin Server is not set the default adress ``` http://localhost:8096/ ``` : edit `MPCJF.js` to replace ``` http://localhost:8096/ ``` with your Jellyfin web URL, for exemple :
  ```
  // @match        http://192.168.1.10:8096/*
  ```
	##### - Don't forget the * at the end.
	##### - If you did any change, Uncheck Allow Updates & Allow Modification so you don't have to do it again if I update this script.
	###### To find and modify the installed `MPCJF.js` Browser settings → Extensions → **Violentmonkey** → Options → Go to **Installed Scripts** > ***`</>`***

### 5. Enable PowerShell Scripts Execution to allow MPCJF.ps1
- In Windows 11, go to, Settings → Developers → PowerShell → Allow unsigned scripts
- Or if you can't find it :
	- Search for `PowerShell` in the Start menu, right-click it, and select **Run as Administrator**.
	- Type the following command and press Enter:
     ```
     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
     ```
- Or
     ```
     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
     ```
### 6. Apply MPC-JF Registry Settings
- Run `MPCJF.reg` and confirm changes.
- You may need to re-run `MPCJF.reg` after major MPC Updates.

### Optionnal :  Hide the Powerscript window at MPC-JF launch
- `Install-MPCJF-HiddenProtocol.ps1` must be in your default MPC-JF folder.
- It **require VBScript** installed (may not be installed by default on all Windows 11 installation)
- Run the file `Install-MPCJF-HiddenProtocol.ps1` (Right click and ***Run with PowerShell***)

### Optional : Adjust Full-Screen Settings
- Edit "MPCJF.ps1" located in ``` C:\ProgramData\MPC-JF ```
- At the end of the script, remove or readd ```/fullscreen```

### 7. Done !
- Refresh Jellyfin Web UI and you can test if it works already. If not, see Workaround below.

### Workaround : If MPC starts but fail to launch the media
- Your NAS/network drives must be mount with a letter like D:\ E:\ ... in Windows.
- Edit "MPCJF.ps1" located in ``` C:\ProgramData\MPC-JF ```
  	- At the end of the file, just below : ``` # YOUR NAS CONFIG, IF NEEDED, ADD YOUR OWN WORKAROUND JUST BELOW ```
  	- For each drive, add this line : ``` $path = $path -replace "\\share\\SHAREFOLDER\\", "D:" ```
  	- In this, change ``` "\\share\\SHAREFOLDER\\" ```
  	  It should be ***the part*** of the path that appear in your NAS (and maybe in your library path in Jellyfin server too), but not appearing in the Windows explorer path of your movies. 
  	- Add double backslash ``` \\ ``` instead of single backslash ``` \ ``` in your own path, they are essential.
  	- Replace "D:" with the corresponding drive letter in Windows.
  	- For exemple ``` $path = $path -replace "\\share\\MEDIA\\", "D:" ```
	That works for everything located in my NAS mounted as the D: drive in Windows, so D:\FILMS, D:\SERIES, D:\FILMS\folder1\Movie1.mkv etc.
	``` "\\share\\\MEDIA\\" ``` depends of your NAS/drives configuration (see your NAS and Jellyfin library path to identify your issue)
  	- If you have other drives, do the same for them by adding lines below.
  	- No need to do add lines for every library folder, just one line for each different drive should be enough.

#### Files in C:\ProgramData\MPC-JF
- ``` MPCJF.ps1 ``` : Do not delete. Main Script.
- ``` MPCJF.reg ``` : Do not delete. You may need to run it again if the script don't run anymore, maybe after some MPC updates.
- ``` Install-MPCJF-HiddenProtocol.ps1 ``` : One time run to hide the Powershell window at MPC launch. You may need to run it again if the script don't run hidden anymore
- ``` MPCJF.js ``` : backup file of the main browser script, it's also in ViolentMonkey in your browser. Use this one if an auto-update of the script have broken things for you.

---

#### Troubleshooting :
- Sometimes if it stop working, because of idk, **MPC updates** or some specific settings change, just **re-run** `MPCJF.reg` (& `Install-MPCJF-HiddenProtocol.ps1`).
- If MPC takes time to launch the media, it's because HDDs are in standby, the script is waiting for your HDD to respond. I have made a tiny watcher that wake up my NAS HDDs at JF Home screen for faster first play here : 
[jellyfin-nas-hdd-spinup](https://github.com/Damocles-fr/jellyfin-nas-hdd-spinup)
- To uninstall `Install-MPCJF-HiddenProtocol.ps1` : run in Powershell :
     ```
     Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "HKCU:\Software\Classes\MPCJF" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
     Remove-Item -Recurse -Force (Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "MPCJF") -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
     ```
- The .js userscript can be put in Jellyfin JavaScript Injector plugin instead, but every play buttons in Jellyfin Web won't work anywhere else without MPC and MPC-JF.
- If you use the Firefox extension ``` Dark Reader ``` , it breaks Jellyfin pictures loading in browsers, desactivate it only for jellyfin : Go into Dark Reader settings while you have the Jellyfin page open (firefox menu bar), click to  Jellyfin URL.
